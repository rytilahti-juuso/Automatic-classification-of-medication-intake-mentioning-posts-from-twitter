# Automatic-classification-of-medication-intake-mentioning-posts-from-twitter
Code for my original B.C. thesis topic. Wrote the code, then changed B.C. thesis subject to comparing gamification frameworks. The gamification thesis can be found [Here](https://github.com/rytilahti-juuso/bc-thesis-comparing-gamification-frameworks)  (available only in Finnish).


The description of the task which this code is aimed to solve is available [Here](https://healthlanguageprocessing.org/smm4h18/social-media-mining-for-health-applications-smm4h-workshop-shared-task/) (TASK 2: Automatic classification of posts describing medication intakeâ€”three-class classification).
